# HOTELS
A Web-base App - and Mobile Phones App LATER

**For the hotel web-based app listings**

In the Navbar – which could be Sidebar with Dark and Light Mode. _(I’ve made the sidebar but required more changes with the current listings)._ 

- [ ] a.	Home – landing page
- [ ] b.	About
- [ ] c.	Galleries – in the absence of galleries then Services
- [ ] d.	Bookings 
- [ ] e.	Contact 

**Now, submenu** 

a.	The landing page should be the overview that contain Hotel Name, Address, Contact Number, Ratings and Reviews. Also, the Image of the Hotel (Full image suggested) and the Room Pictures according to its classifications and with descriptions, also Front Desk etc

Another side could also contain Amenities such as Free Wi-Fi, Car Rentals, Meeting Events Space, Non-Smoking Area, and Smoking Area, 24hour Room Service, Safe deposit boxes, front desk, Valet dry-cleaning, Foreign Exchange and etc
It will have Logo at the Header and Footer with other things like social media contact etc.
